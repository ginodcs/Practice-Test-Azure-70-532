            Once an App Service Web App has been created, how can the VM Size (CPU and Memory) be changed for the VM's that host the Web App?
        </section>
        <section class="answer">The Web App must be deleted, then re-created.</section>
        <section class="answer">Adjust the CPU core count and/or Memeory capacity of the VM to the desired amount.</section>
        <section class="answer" data-correct>Change the Pricing Tier for the Web App to the one with the desired CPU/Memory resources.</section>

            How is Traffic Manager implemented to route Web App traffic to an appropriate website endpoint?
        </section>
        <section class="answer">It acts as a Proxy where all website traffic flows through, then gets routed to the correct endpoint.</section>
        <section class="answer" data-correct>It's configured at the DNS level, so that DNS resolution directs which endpoint to route traffic to.</section>

            What is Failover Load Balancing?
        </section>
        <section class="answer">Once a request fails on an endpoing, it is then automatically redirected to a different endpoing.</section>
        <section class="answer" data-correct>Traffic is directed to Healthy endpoints as the result of monitoring, so that traffic is not directed to a server that is in a state of failure.</section>

            What is Round Robin Load Balancing?
        </section>
        <section class="answer" data-correct>Each traffic request is directed to the next endpoint in the list of endpoints so traffic is evenly distrubuted across all endpoints.</section>
        <section class="answer">Traffic is randomly distributed to endpoints so traffic is evenly distributed across all endpoings.</section>

            How is Performance Load Balancing performed?
        </section>
        <section class="answer">Traffic is routed to the endpoint with the VM that has the most available CPU/Memory available.</section>
        <section class="answer" data-correct>Traffic is routed via DNS to the "closest" endpoint based on the lowest latency between the client and the Azure Data Center hosting the endpoint.</section>
        <section class="answer">Traffic is routed via DNS to the endpoint with the fastest response times.</section>
